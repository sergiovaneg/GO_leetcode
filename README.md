# GO Leetcode

I started this repo to both learn how to code in GoLang and train my problem-solving skills. First, I try to reach a working solution on my own. Then, if I am not satisfied with my results, I look for a tutorial (preferably not in Go) and try to implement someone else's algorithm by myself.
